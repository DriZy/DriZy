- I am Idris Tabi, a Software Engineer and consultant at Zinger Sytems, Cameroon. I pilot and work on in-house projects and contribute code to client projects. I am also in charge of training recruits. It has been my privilege to conduct several web development training in my community for newbies, tech enthusiasts, and engineering students from home-based universities and organisations. Therefore, with my technological expertise, I am eager to contribute to projects that will significantly impact my community and the world.
